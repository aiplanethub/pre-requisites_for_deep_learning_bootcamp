## Anaconda

* Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python. It makes it easy to run Python code on your laptop/computer.

* **Again, why Anaconda?** - Well, we are humans and always want user-friendly applications. And that's what Anaconda does for you. It offers a powerful tool called "Jupyter notebook," an easy-to-use and interactive Python environment for data science.

## Installation

### For Windows

* Step1: Install Python 
  * [Direct download link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Step 2: Download and install Anaconda [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

### For Other OS

## Google Colab - Online Environment to Run Python Code

  * Google Colab is the simplest way to set up an interactive notebook environment to perform your data science tasks.
  * The environment offers you up to 12 GB RAM/GPU for free and 100 GB storage.
  * You donâ€™t need to worry about installing a bulky python application on your laptop/computer

In case you are opening the video on YouTube, you may _**start from 24 secs and watch till 3 mins 10 secs**_ (rest will be covered later)

There seems to be some issue with visibility in the video with the print function. The print function is usually used as print(z). However, in the video, it appears to be print.(z). due to a screen recording issue, so please use the correct one, i.e., print(z).
